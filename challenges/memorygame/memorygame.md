# DEVELOP A MEMORY GAME 

## DESCRIPTION

    The goal of this challenge is to develop a memory game. The game consists of a grid of cards. Each card has a symbol on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The player flips two cards over each turn. If the two cards have the same symbol, they remain face up. Otherwise, the cards flip back over after a short period of time. The goal of the game is to match all pairs of cards.

## INSTRUCTIONS (BASE CHALLENGE)

### 1. Choose a programming language of your choice.
### 2. Choose a topic for your cards. Some examples are:
        - Colors 
        - Star Wars characters (you can choose this API https://akabab.github.io/starwars-api/#alljson)
        - Pokemon characters (you can choose this API https://pokeapi.co/)
        - Countries (you can choose this API https://flagsapi.com/#quick)

###  3. Develop the game. You can use the following steps as a guide:
        - Create a grid of cards. The grid should be 4x4, 6x6, or 8x8.
        - Choose number of players. The game can be played by one or two players.
        - Add a card to the grid. The card should have a symbol on one side.
        - Shuffle the cards on the grid.
        - Add a click event to each card. When the player clicks a card, the card flips over.
        - When the player clicks two cards, check if the cards have the same symbol. If the cards have the same symbol, the cards remain face up. Otherwise, the cards flip back over.
        - When all pairs of cards are matched, the player wins the game.

## ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES 

Pick one or more of the following challenges to add to your game:

1. Add a timer to the game. The player has a limited amount of time to match all pairs of cards.
1. Include the ability to select the topic of the cards by using the available APIs.
   - Add a color theme based on the selected topic. (e.g., if the topic is Star Wars characters, the color theme could be black and yellow). 
1. Improve the game design. Add animations, sounds, and other visual effects to make the game more engaging.
1. Allow Players to input their names and keep track of their scores. This should both work for single and double player games.
